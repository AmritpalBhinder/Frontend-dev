        <p style="padding-top: 20%;">Testimonials are most powerful in attracting 
            new business, when your happy customers focus 
            on the benefits, performance, quality, or value 
            they’ve seen since they discovered your business. 
            The most convincing testimonials credibly tell a 
            story about how you helped your customers solve a 
            relatable problem, in a way that suggests someone 
            else like them could experience the same benefits.</p>
